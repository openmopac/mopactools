# mopactools

This Python package is primarily a Python wrapper for API calls to the [Molecular Orbital PACkage (MOPAC)](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac),
which includes launching conventional MOPAC calculations from an input file. It is also intended to be a
collection of pre-processing and post-processing tools to enhance the productivity of MOPAC users. User
contributions of new tools are welcome and encouraged.
